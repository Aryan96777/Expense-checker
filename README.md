# 💰 Expense Tracker (Vanilla JavaScript)

A simple, efficient, and responsive web application designed to help users track their daily income and expenses. This project was developed as part of my Web Development Internship at Codec Technologies.

## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Entry:** Add items with names and amounts instantly.
* **Live Calculations:** Automatically calculates the total balance as you add or remove items.
* **Persistent View:** Uses a clean table layout to display all transactions.
* **Validation:** Ensures users enter valid data before updating the list.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Structured the data entry forms and display table.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling for a modern, user-friendly interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Handled the core logic, event listeners, and DOM manipulation.

## 🧠 Project Logic (For Presentation)
1. **Event Listeners:** The app waits for a 'Click' event on the add button.
2. **State Management:** Data is stored in a JavaScript array.
3. **DOM Manipulation:** The script creates new `<tr>` (table row) elements dynamically to update the UI without a page refresh.
